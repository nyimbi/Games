      "options": ["H2O", "CO2", "NaCl", "O2"],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "Water is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, hence H2O.",
      "time_limit_seconds": 30,
      "theme_connection": "Are We There Yet? — Water is essential for every journey, from ancient sea voyages to sustaining life on Mars.",
      "deep_explanation": "The chemical formula H2O tells us each water molecule contains exactly 2 hydrogen atoms bonded to 1 oxygen atom. These bonds are covalent, meaning the atoms share electrons. Water's polarity (slightly positive hydrogen side, slightly negative oxygen side) gives it unique properties like surface tension and its ability to dissolve many substances, earning it the title 'universal solvent.'",

      "options": ["Venus", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn"],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Mars appears red due to iron oxide (rust) on its surface.",
      "time_limit_seconds": 30,
      "theme_connection": "Are We There Yet? — Mars is humanity's next great destination, and the question of whether we'll arrive there defines our generation.",
      "deep_explanation": "Mars gets its red color from iron oxide (Fe2O3), commonly known as rust, which covers much of its surface. Billions of years ago, Mars likely had liquid water and a thicker atmosphere. The iron in Martian rocks oxidized over time as the planet lost its magnetic field and atmosphere, creating the distinctive red dust that covers the planet today.",

      "options": ["Oxygen", "Carbon Dioxide", "Nitrogen", "Hydrogen"],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen through photosynthesis.",
      "time_limit_seconds": 30,
      "theme_connection": "Are We There Yet? — Our progress toward climate goals depends on understanding the carbon cycle and how plants help regulate atmospheric CO2.",
      "deep_explanation": "During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight energy to convert CO2 and water into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen. This process occurs in chloroplasts, using the green pigment chlorophyll. Plants absorb about 25% of human CO2 emissions, making forests critical carbon sinks. Deforestation disrupts this balance, accelerating climate change.",

      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Adults have 206 bones. Babies are born with about 270 bones, which fuse together as they grow.",
      "time_limit_seconds": 30,
      "theme_connection": "Are We There Yet? — In space travel, astronauts lose bone density at ~1% per month, one of the major obstacles to reaching Mars.",
      "deep_explanation": "Babies are born with approximately 270 soft bones made largely of cartilage. As children grow, many of these bones fuse together, eventually reaching the adult count of 206. The smallest bone is the stapes in the ear (3mm). In microgravity, astronauts lose 1-2% of bone mass per month because bones need gravity-induced stress to maintain density — a major challenge for long-duration space travel.",

      "theme_connection": "Are We There Yet? — Skin acts as our first line of defense on any journey, from UV protection to temperature regulation across different climates.",
      "deep_explanation": "Adult skin covers approximately 1.7-2.0 square meters (about 20 sq ft) and weighs 3.5-10 kg. It consists of three layers: epidermis (outer barrier), dermis (structural support with blood vessels and nerves), and hypodermis (fat insulation). Skin replaces itself every 27 days, produces vitamin D from sunlight, and contains specialized receptors for touch, pressure, temperature, and pain.",

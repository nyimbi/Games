      "deep_explanation": "Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet around 1594-1596, basing it on an Italian tale by Matteo Bandello. The play explores how the feuding Montague and Capulet families' hatred creates an impossible journey for the young lovers. The story's endurance (over 400 years) shows how universal themes of love, conflict, and the desire to 'arrive' at happiness transcend time periods. The play has been adapted into over 30 film versions, including West Side Story.",

The series has sold over 500 million copies worldwide, been translated into 80+ languages, and spawned a film franchise grossing $7.7 billion. The title was changed to 'Sorcerer's Stone' in the US because publishers feared American children wouldn't know what a philosopher was.",

The book revolutionized early reading education by proving that learning materials could be engaging and fun, selling over 10 million copies.",

The phrase 'tilting at windmills' (attacking imaginary enemies) comes directly from this novel and has entered languages worldwide.",

The novel's opening line — 'It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife' — is one of the most famous in English literature. Austen used irony and social commentary to critique the marriage market of Regency England, and the novel has never gone out of print.",

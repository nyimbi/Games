## Game Design by Competition Event

### 1. Scholar's Bowl (Team Trivia)

**Competition Format**: Teams of 3 collaborate to answer questions, with points for correct answers and bonuses for team consensus.

**Objective**: Improve quick recall, teamwork, subject knowledge, and strategic buzzing.

**Materials Needed**:
- Buzzer system (app: "Buzzer" or physical buzzers)
- Timer (phone or kitchen timer)
- Question cards (index cards work well)
- Whiteboard for scoring
- Subject category labels

#### Games

**1. Buzzer Battle** ⏱️ 15-20 min
- *Setup*: 2-3 players per team, one designated "buzzer captain"
- *How*: Rapid-fire questions across subjects. First correct buzz wins points. Incorrect buzz loses 1 point.
- *Sample Questions*:
  - "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?" (Science)
  - "In what year did World War II end?" (Social Studies)
  - "Who painted the Mona Lisa?" (Arts)
- *Scoring*: +2 correct, -1 incorrect buzz
- *Why*: Simulates real Scholar's Bowl pressure; teaches when to buzz vs. wait
- *Difficulty Progression*:
  - Week 1-2: 10-second answer window
  - Week 3-4: 7-second window
  - Week 5+: 5-second window

**2. Category Challenge** ⏱️ 20-25 min
- *Setup*: Create 5 category decks matching WSC subjects
- *How*: Teams draw cards from chosen category. Must answer within 10 seconds. Teams can "pass" once per round to teammate.
- *Team Strategy Element*: Before each round, teams secretly assign a "specialist" for each category
- *Why*: Builds breadth of knowledge; teaches team role assignment
- *Variation*: "Double Down" - teams can wager points on confident answers

**3. Team Trivia Night** ⏱️ 30-45 min
- *Setup*: 10-15 questions per subject, mixed difficulty
- *How*: Weekly trivia using Kahoot, Quizizz, or Blooket. Teams huddle before submitting answers.
- *Structure*:
  - Round 1: Individual quick-fire (warm-up)
  - Round 2: Team consensus required
  - Round 3: "All-In" high-stakes questions
- *Why*: Reinforces learning through competition; builds weekly habit
- *Digital Tools*: [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com), [Quizizz](https://quizizz.com), [Blooket](https://blooket.com)

**4. Scavenger Bowl** ⏱️ 25 min | NEW
- *Setup*: Hide answer cards around the room/house

### Difficulty Adaptation

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| >80% correct consistently | Increase difficulty or time pressure |
| 60-80% correct | Good zone; maintain current level |
| <60% correct | Reduce difficulty; add scaffolding |
| Frustration visible | Switch to a "win" activity; rebuild confidence |

### Progress Tracking

Create a simple tracking sheet:

```
Scholar: _________________ | Month: _________

| Skill Area | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4 |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Quick Recall | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
